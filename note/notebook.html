            Q1:- C:\Users\Sushant>parcel index.html Server running at http://localhost:1234 × Build failed. unknown:
            Entry C:\Users\Sushant\index.html does not exist
            <br><br>
            ANS - The error message unknown: Entry C:\Users\Sushant\index.html does not exist indicates that Parcel is
            trying to find the index.html file in the wrong location. It's looking in C:\Users\Sushant\ but based on
            your previous command prompt, your working directory seems to be different.
        <h1>How to Resolve This:</h1>
        1.Ensure You're in the Correct Directory: Make sure you're in the project folder where your index.html file is
        located. For example, if your project is in C:\xampp\htdocs\nodeandreact\interviewjs, you need to navigate
        to that directory first.

        Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
        Use the cd command (change directory) to navigate to the folder where your index.html file is located. For
        example:
        bash
        Copy
        cd C:\xampp\htdocs\nodeandreact\interviewjs
        <br>
        2. Verify the index.html File Exists: After navigating to the correct directory, make sure the index.html file
        exists in that directory. You can list the files in your current directory with the dir command (in Command
        Prompt) or ls command (in PowerShell):

        In Command Prompt:
        bash
        Copy
        dir
        In PowerShell:
        bash
        Copy
        ls
        Ensure that index.html is in the list of files in that directory.

        Run Parcel from the Correct Directory: Once you're in the correct directory where index.html is located, run the
        following command:

        bash
        Copy
        parcel index.html
        This should start the Parcel development server and open the app in the browser at http://localhost:1234.

        <h4>Q2: I notice that when i installed parcel globally, it was not get install in our folder node_module
            directory , why? then where does it was?</h4>
        ANS:- When you install a package globally (using the -g flag), it is not installed in your project's
        node_modules directory. Instead, global packages are installed in a system-wide location, separate from your
        project folder. This allows you to use the package across all projects on your system without having to install
        it repeatedly.

        <h2>Here's why and where global packages are installed:</h2>
        Why Global Packages Are Not in node_modules:
        Global Installation: When you install a package globally, it's not specific to any single project. The package
        is installed in a global location that is shared across all your projects, so you can use it from anywhere on
        your system without installing it again for every project.
        Project-Specific Installation: When you install a package locally, it's installed into the node_modules folder
        of your current project. This keeps dependencies isolated and ensures that each project has its own versions of
        dependencies without affecting others.
        <h2>Where Are Global Packages Installed?</h2>
        The location of globally installed packages depends on your system and configuration. Below are the default
        locations for different operating systems:

        1. On Windows:
        The global packages are usually installed in a directory like:
        bash
        Copy
        C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
            The global parcel.ps1 script (PowerShell) would be located in:
            bash
            Copy
            C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\parcel.ps1
                2. On macOS/Linux:
                The global packages are installed in a directory like:
                bash
                Copy
                /usr/local/lib/node_modules
                or sometimes in your home directory:
                bash
                Copy
                ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules
                The executables (like parcel) are linked into a directory in your $PATH, which makes them accessible
                from the command line.
                3. To Find Where Global Packages Are Installed:
                You can run the following command to check where your global npm packages are installed:

                bash
                Copy
                npm root -g
                This will print the path to the global node_modules directory.

                <h2> How to Access Global Packages:</h2>
                Running a Global Package: Once a package is installed globally, you can run it from anywhere in your
                terminal (command line) because global packages are added to your system's PATH.
                For example, after installing parcel globally, you can run:
                bash
                Copy
                parcel index.html
                And this will work, even if you're not in the project folder where parcel is installed, because parcel
                is available globally.
                Key Differences:
                Local installation: Packages are installed inside node_modules in the project directory.
                Global installation: Packages are installed in a global location, accessible from anywhere, without
                being tied to a single project.
                Conclusion:
                When you install a package globally, it is not stored in your project's node_modules folder. It is
                stored in a system-wide location, making it accessible for use in any project.
                To check where global packages are installed, you can run npm root -g.

                <h4>Q4:-why do list item need key ??</h4>
                ANS -> In React, when rendering a list of items, each item should be given a <span
                    style="color: red;">key</span> prop to uniquely identify it. This is important for several reasons,
                particularly for performance and the efficient updating of the DOM.

                <h4>Reasons why list items need a key:</h4>
                <h4>Efficient Reconciliation:</h4>

                React uses a process called <span style="color: brown;">Reconciliation</span> to update the DOM
                efficiently. When an item in a list changes
                (for example, if an item is added, removed, or reordered), React needs a way to identify which items
                have changed, and which ones haven't.
                The key helps React quickly identify which elements have been modified, added, or removed.
                Without a unique key, React will have to re-render the entire list whenever a change occurs, leading to
                unnecessary work and performance issues.
                <h4> React Track Elements:</h4>

                The key allows React to keep track of each element between re-renders. If React doesn't have a way to
                uniquely identify an item, it may incorrectly reuse a DOM element for a different item when the list
                changes, leading to issues like incorrect content being displayed or missing elements.
                For example, if you add a new item in the middle of the list and do not have a key, React might not be
                able to detect that a new item was inserted, and instead might re-render the list incorrectly.
                <h4>Optimized DOM Updates:</h4>

                With a key, React can compare the current state of the list with the previous state and figure out the
                exact change required (i.e., which item to add, remove, or move), instead of re-rendering the entire
                list.
                This optimization significantly improves performance, especially when working with large lists.

                <h4>Q5. I don't understand locally installed package and globally installed package and npx and npm
                    working?</h4>
                Ans : Let’s break down locally installed packages, globally installed packages, and the difference
                between npm and npx to give you a clearer understanding.
                <br><br>
                <h3>1. Local vs Global Package Installation</h3>
                <h4>Local Package Installation:</h4>
                A local package is installed inside the project folder (usually in the node_modules directory).
                It is meant to be used only within that project.
                When you run a command from a local package, you can’t directly access it from the command line. You
                would need to either run it through npx or use npm run to reference it.
                Local packages are useful when you want to use a tool in only one project, without affecting other
                projects.
                <br><br>
                Example of installing a local package:
                <span style="color:red;">npm install parcel --save-dev</span>
                This installs Parcel only in the current project, and the package will be located in the node_modules
                folder. You would need to access it through npx or npm run (which references it from node_modules).

                <h4>Global Package Installation:</h4>
                A global package is installed once and can be used across all projects on your system.<br>
                Global packages are accessible from the command line anywhere on your computer.<br>
                You generally install packages globally for tools you use across multiple projects (e.g., linters, build
                tools, etc.).<br><br>
                Example of installing a global package:


                <span style="color:red;">npm install -g parcel</span>
                This installs Parcel globally on your computer, so you can use the parcel command anywhere in your
                terminal, without needing to install it in each project.

                <h3>2. What is npm and How Does It Work?</h3>
                npm is the package manager for JavaScript and Node.js.
                It is used to install, manage, and run packages (like libraries and tools) in your projects.
                <br>
                When you run commands like:

                <span style="color:red;"> npm install <package-name></span>
                It installs the package either locally (inside the current project folder) or globally (on your entire
                system, if you use -g).
                When you use npm with a local package:
                You usually need to access the local package via an npm script (defined in package.json) or with npx.
                <br><br>
                For example, in package.json:

                "scripts": {
                "start": "parcel index.html"
                }
                You can run:
                <span style="color:red;">npm run start</span>
                This will run the parcel command from node_modules/.bin/parcel.

                <h3>3. What is npx and How Does It Work?</h3>
                npx is a tool that comes with npm (since npm 5.2).
                It is used to run executables (like parcel) that are installed locally or temporarily, without needing
                to reference them explicitly in package.json.
                npx allows you to run commands from local dependencies or even download and run a package temporarily
                without installing it globally or locally.
                Example with npx:
                If Parcel is installed locally in your project, you can run it directly using npx:


                npx parcel index.html
                This will search for Parcel in your local node_modules folder and run it.
                If Parcel is not installed locally, npx will download and run Parcel temporarily.
                Why does npx work with local packages?
                npx automatically looks for executables in node_modules/.bin and runs them. So you can run commands from
                locally installed packages without manually setting up scripts in package.json.

                <h3>In Summary:</h3>
                Local Package Installation:
                Installed inside a specific project (e.g., node_modules).
                Used only within the project.
                To run commands from local packages, you need to use npx or npm run.
                <h3>Global Package Installation:</h3>
                Installed globally on your system.
                Accessible from anywhere in your terminal.
                You can directly run commands (e.g., parcel) after installing them globally.
                npm:
                Used to install and manage packages in your project.
                <span style="color:red;">npm install <package> </span>installs a package either locally or globally.
                <br>
                To run local packages, you typically use scripts in package.json or npx.
                npx:
                Executes commands from local packages without needing to add them to package.json.
                If the package is not installed locally, npx will temporarily download and run it.
                <br>
                <h3>Quick Examples:</h3>
                <h4>Installing a package locally:</h4>

                <span style="color:red;">npm install parcel --save-dev</span>
                This installs Parcel locally in the node_modules folder.

                To run Parcel, use:

                <span style="color:red;">npx parcel index.html</span>
                <h4>Installing a package globally:</h4>

                <span style="color:red;">npm install -g parcel</span>
                This installs Parcel globally on your system.
                To run Parcel anywhere, use:

                <span style="color:red;">parcel index.html</span>
                <br>
                <h4>Why use npx instead of npm for local packages?</h4>
                If you install Parcel locally using npm install parcel --save-dev, you can use npx parcel index.html
                without having to modify package.json.
                This allows you to run tools and commands that are only needed for your specific project without having
                to install them globally.
