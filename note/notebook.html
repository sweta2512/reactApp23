            Q1:- C:\Users\Sushant>parcel index.html Server running at http://localhost:1234 × Build failed. unknown:
            Entry C:\Users\Sushant\index.html does not exist
            <br><br>
            ANS - The error message unknown: Entry C:\Users\Sushant\index.html does not exist indicates that Parcel is
            trying to find the index.html file in the wrong location. It's looking in C:\Users\Sushant\ but based on
            your previous command prompt, your working directory seems to be different.
        <h1>How to Resolve This:</h1>
        1.Ensure You're in the Correct Directory: Make sure you're in the project folder where your index.html file is
        located. For example, if your project is in C:\xampp\htdocs\nodeandreact\interviewjs, you need to navigate
        to that directory first.

        Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
        Use the cd command (change directory) to navigate to the folder where your index.html file is located. For
        example:
        bash
        Copy
        cd C:\xampp\htdocs\nodeandreact\interviewjs
        <br>
        2. Verify the index.html File Exists: After navigating to the correct directory, make sure the index.html file
        exists in that directory. You can list the files in your current directory with the dir command (in Command
        Prompt) or ls command (in PowerShell):

        In Command Prompt:
        bash
        Copy
        dir
        In PowerShell:
        bash
        Copy
        ls
        Ensure that index.html is in the list of files in that directory.

        Run Parcel from the Correct Directory: Once you're in the correct directory where index.html is located, run the
        following command:

        bash
        Copy
        parcel index.html
        This should start the Parcel development server and open the app in the browser at http://localhost:1234.

        <h4>Q2: I notice that when i installed parcel globally, it was not get install in our folder node_module
            directory , why? then where does it was?</h4>
        ANS:- When you install a package globally (using the -g flag), it is not installed in your project's
        node_modules directory. Instead, global packages are installed in a system-wide location, separate from your
        project folder. This allows you to use the package across all projects on your system without having to install
        it repeatedly.

        <h2>Here's why and where global packages are installed:</h2>
        Why Global Packages Are Not in node_modules:
        Global Installation: When you install a package globally, it's not specific to any single project. The package
        is installed in a global location that is shared across all your projects, so you can use it from anywhere on
        your system without installing it again for every project.
        Project-Specific Installation: When you install a package locally, it's installed into the node_modules folder
        of your current project. This keeps dependencies isolated and ensures that each project has its own versions of
        dependencies without affecting others.
        <h2>Where Are Global Packages Installed?</h2>
        The location of globally installed packages depends on your system and configuration. Below are the default
        locations for different operating systems:

        1. On Windows:
        The global packages are usually installed in a directory like:
        bash
        Copy
        C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
            The global parcel.ps1 script (PowerShell) would be located in:
            bash
            Copy
            C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\parcel.ps1
                2. On macOS/Linux:
                The global packages are installed in a directory like:
                bash
                Copy
                /usr/local/lib/node_modules
                or sometimes in your home directory:
                bash
                Copy
                ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules
                The executables (like parcel) are linked into a directory in your $PATH, which makes them accessible
                from the command line.
                3. To Find Where Global Packages Are Installed:
                You can run the following command to check where your global npm packages are installed:

                bash
                Copy
                npm root -g
                This will print the path to the global node_modules directory.

                <h2> How to Access Global Packages:</h2>
                Running a Global Package: Once a package is installed globally, you can run it from anywhere in your
                terminal (command line) because global packages are added to your system's PATH.
                For example, after installing parcel globally, you can run:
                bash
                Copy
                parcel index.html
                And this will work, even if you're not in the project folder where parcel is installed, because parcel
                is available globally.
                Key Differences:
                Local installation: Packages are installed inside node_modules in the project directory.
                Global installation: Packages are installed in a global location, accessible from anywhere, without
                being tied to a single project.
                Conclusion:
                When you install a package globally, it is not stored in your project's node_modules folder. It is
                stored in a system-wide location, making it accessible for use in any project.
                To check where global packages are installed, you can run npm root -g.

                <h4>Q4:-why do list item need key ??</h4>
                ANS -> In React, when rendering a list of items, each item should be given a <span
                    style="color: red;">key</span> prop to uniquely identify it. This is important for several reasons,
                particularly for performance and the efficient updating of the DOM.

                <h4>Reasons why list items need a key:</h4>
                <h4>Efficient Reconciliation:</h4>

                React uses a process called <span style="color: brown;">Reconciliation</span> to update the DOM
                efficiently. When an item in a list changes
                (for example, if an item is added, removed, or reordered), React needs a way to identify which items
                have changed, and which ones haven't.
                The key helps React quickly identify which elements have been modified, added, or removed.
                Without a unique key, React will have to re-render the entire list whenever a change occurs, leading to
                unnecessary work and performance issues.
                <h4> React Track Elements:</h4>

                The key allows React to keep track of each element between re-renders. If React doesn't have a way to
                uniquely identify an item, it may incorrectly reuse a DOM element for a different item when the list
                changes, leading to issues like incorrect content being displayed or missing elements.
                For example, if you add a new item in the middle of the list and do not have a key, React might not be
                able to detect that a new item was inserted, and instead might re-render the list incorrectly.
                <h4>Optimized DOM Updates:</h4>

                With a key, React can compare the current state of the list with the previous state and figure out the
                exact change required (i.e., which item to add, remove, or move), instead of re-rendering the entire
                list.
                This optimization significantly improves performance, especially when working with large lists.

                <h4>Q5. I don't understand locally installed package and globally installed package and npx and npm
                    working?</h4>
                Ans : Let’s break down locally installed packages, globally installed packages, and the difference
                between npm and npx to give you a clearer understanding.
                <br><br>
                <h3>1. Local vs Global Package Installation</h3>
                <h4>Local Package Installation:</h4>
                A local package is installed inside the project folder (usually in the node_modules directory).
                It is meant to be used only within that project.
                When you run a command from a local package, you can’t directly access it from the command line. You
                would need to either run it through npx or use npm run to reference it.
                Local packages are useful when you want to use a tool in only one project, without affecting other
                projects.
                <br><br>
                Example of installing a local package:
                <span style="color:red;">npm install parcel --save-dev</span>
                This installs Parcel only in the current project, and the package will be located in the node_modules
                folder. You would need to access it through npx or npm run (which references it from node_modules).

                <h4>Global Package Installation:</h4>
                A global package is installed once and can be used across all projects on your system.<br>
                Global packages are accessible from the command line anywhere on your computer.<br>
                You generally install packages globally for tools you use across multiple projects (e.g., linters, build
                tools, etc.).<br><br>
                Example of installing a global package:


                <span style="color:red;">npm install -g parcel</span>
                This installs Parcel globally on your computer, so you can use the parcel command anywhere in your
                terminal, without needing to install it in each project.

                <h3>2. What is npm and How Does It Work?</h3>
                npm is the package manager for JavaScript and Node.js.
                It is used to install, manage, and run packages (like libraries and tools) in your projects.
                <br>
                When you run commands like:

                <span style="color:red;"> npm install <package-name></span>
                It installs the package either locally (inside the current project folder) or globally (on your entire
                system, if you use -g).
                When you use npm with a local package:
                You usually need to access the local package via an npm script (defined in package.json) or with npx.
                <br><br>
                For example, in package.json:

                "scripts": {
                "start": "parcel index.html"
                }
                You can run:
                <span style="color:red;">npm run start</span>
                This will run the parcel command from node_modules/.bin/parcel.

                <h3>3. What is npx and How Does It Work?</h3>
                npx is a tool that comes with npm (since npm 5.2).
                It is used to run executables (like parcel) that are installed locally or temporarily, without needing
                to reference them explicitly in package.json.
                npx allows you to run commands from local dependencies or even download and run a package temporarily
                without installing it globally or locally.
                Example with npx:
                If Parcel is installed locally in your project, you can run it directly using npx:


                npx parcel index.html
                This will search for Parcel in your local node_modules folder and run it.
                If Parcel is not installed locally, npx will download and run Parcel temporarily.
                Why does npx work with local packages?
                npx automatically looks for executables in node_modules/.bin and runs them. So you can run commands from
                locally installed packages without manually setting up scripts in package.json.

                <h3>In Summary:</h3>
                Local Package Installation:
                Installed inside a specific project (e.g., node_modules).
                Used only within the project.
                To run commands from local packages, you need to use npx or npm run.
                <h3>Global Package Installation:</h3>
                Installed globally on your system.
                Accessible from anywhere in your terminal.
                You can directly run commands (e.g., parcel) after installing them globally.
                npm:
                Used to install and manage packages in your project.
                <span style="color:red;">npm install <package> </span>installs a package either locally or globally.
                <br>
                To run local packages, you typically use scripts in package.json or npx.
                npx:
                Executes commands from local packages without needing to add them to package.json.
                If the package is not installed locally, npx will temporarily download and run it.
                <br>
                <h3>Quick Examples:</h3>
                <h4>Installing a package locally:</h4>

                <span style="color:red;">npm install parcel --save-dev</span>
                This installs Parcel locally in the node_modules folder.

                To run Parcel, use:

                <span style="color:red;">npx parcel index.html</span>
                <h4>Installing a package globally:</h4>

                <span style="color:red;">npm install -g parcel</span>
                This installs Parcel globally on your system.
                To run Parcel anywhere, use:

                <span style="color:red;">parcel index.html</span>
                <br>
                <h4>Why use npx instead of npm for local packages?</h4>
                If you install Parcel locally using npm install parcel --save-dev, you can use npx parcel index.html
                without having to modify package.json.
                This allows you to run tools and commands that are only needed for your specific project without having
                to install them globally.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>Q6. Difference between element and component?</h4>
                ANS:An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM
                nodes or other components.
                Elements can contain other Elements in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element
                is created, it cannot be mutated.
                we can create element by using : <br>let element = React.createElement("div", { id: "login-btn" },
                "Login") <br><br>
                Components are javascript function or class, that accept input as prop and return elements.
                It define how UI should appear and behave.Every component can manage their own state and have life cycle
                method.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>Q7: What is Lazy Loading?</h4>
                ANS: -
                Lazy loading is a technique where you only load things when you need them. Imagine you're opening a
                page, and it has a lot of images, videos, or other things on it. Instead of loading everything right
                away (which can make the page slow), lazy loading waits to load images or content only when you scroll
                down to them or when they’re about to be seen.

                <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
                Think of a long webpage, like a news website or a photo gallery. Instead of waiting for the entire page
                (with hundreds of images) to load at once, the images load only when you scroll down to them. This makes
                the page load faster at first, and it doesn't waste time or data loading things you haven’t seen yet.

                <h3>How It Works (in Simple Steps):</h3>
                1.Page Loads Fast: When you first visit a webpage, only the content you see immediately (the top part of
                the page) is loaded. Other things (like images further down) are not loaded yet.

                2.Scroll Down: As you scroll down, the browser (or app) notices when an image or content is near the
                part
                of the screen you can see.

                3.Content Loads When Needed: As soon as that content (like an image or video) is about to be shown, it
                starts loading so it’s ready to show to you.

                <h3>Example in React</h3>
                Here’s how lazy loading works in React, using images as an example:

                Native Lazy Loading for Images:
                React allows you to use the loading="lazy" attribute to automatically make images lazy-loaded:<br><br>

                <'img' src="image.jpg" alt="example image" loading="lazy" /> <br><br>
                This means that the image won’t be loaded right away when the page first loads. Instead, it will only
                load when you scroll down to it.
                <h3>Lazy Loading for React Components:</h3>
                Imagine you have a large app with many components. Instead of loading everything when the page first
                loads, you can use lazy loading to only load components when they are needed.<br>

                Here’s how it works:<br>

                1.You lazy-load a component, meaning it’s only loaded when you actually need it.<br>

                2.You wrap it in Suspense, which shows a loading spinner or message until the component is

                Here, LazyComponent is only loaded when it is needed, which makes the app load faster initially.<br>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                Lazy loading helps your page load faster by only loading content when it is needed.

                It’s like waiting to open a drawer until you actually need something from it, instead of opening it
                right away and
                having to deal with everything at once.

                For images or components in a web app, lazy loading means loading them only when they’re about to be
                shown on the
                screen.

                <h4>Q8: suppose i have image at starting of the app near header than lazy loading will make it slow
                    only?</h4>
                ANS- You're absolutely right to wonder about that! If you have an image at the start of the app, near
                the header
                (meaning it's visible when the page loads), then lazy loading might not be beneficial for that
                particular image.
                In fact, lazy loading could make it slower in this case, because the browser would have to wait until
                the image
                is about to appear in the viewport before it starts loading.<br><br>
                <h3>Here's the logic:</h3>
                <h2>1.For images near the top (visible right away):</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lazy loading would delay the image from loading until it's almost in the viewport (meaning until
                        you scroll
                        to it).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But, since this image is near the top, it’s already visible when the page loads, so lazy loading
                        here delays
                        the image unnecessarily and slows down the experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2.For images lower down (out of view initially)::</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Lazy loading is helpful for images that are further down the page (not visible immediately), as
                        they don’t need to be loaded right away. This way, only the images you're about to see are
                        loaded, making the initial page load faster.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>In short:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For images that are visible immediately (like the one near the header), don't use lazy loading
                        because it would
                        delay the loading, which is unnecessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For images that are further down the page (not visible right away), lazy loading is a good
                        choice to optimize
                        the page load speed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How to Handle This?</h3>
                You can make a distinction between images that should be loaded right away and images that can be
                lazy-loaded. For
                example:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For the header image, don’t add loading="lazy" since it's visible immediately. </li>
                    <li>
                        For images further down the page, you can add loading="lazy" to make them load only when they're
                        near the
                        viewport. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <span>Image that is visible on initial page load (near the header)</span><br>
                 <span>"<'img" src="header-image.jpg" alt="Header" />"</span><br>

                <span>Image further down the page (can use lazy loading)</span><br>
                <span>"<'img' src="below-the-fold-image.jpg" alt="Below the fold" loading="lazy" />"</span>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lazy loading is great for images that are out of view at first (below the fold), but avoid lazy
                        loading for
                        images above the fold (like near the header), as it can actually slow things down instead of
                        speeding up.</li>
                </ul>
