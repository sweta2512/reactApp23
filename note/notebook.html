            Q1:- C:\Users\Sushant>parcel index.html Server running at http://localhost:1234 Ã— Build failed. unknown:
            Entry C:\Users\Sushant\index.html does not exist
            <br><br>
            ANS - The error message unknown: Entry C:\Users\Sushant\index.html does not exist indicates that Parcel is
            trying to find the index.html file in the wrong location. It's looking in C:\Users\Sushant\ but based on
            your previous command prompt, your working directory seems to be different.
        <h1>How to Resolve This:</h1>
        1.Ensure You're in the Correct Directory: Make sure you're in the project folder where your index.html file is
        located. For example, if your project is in C:\xampp\htdocs\nodeandreact\interviewjs, you need to navigate
        to that directory first.

        Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
        Use the cd command (change directory) to navigate to the folder where your index.html file is located. For
        example:
        bash
        Copy
        cd C:\xampp\htdocs\nodeandreact\interviewjs
        <br>
        2. Verify the index.html File Exists: After navigating to the correct directory, make sure the index.html file
        exists in that directory. You can list the files in your current directory with the dir command (in Command
        Prompt) or ls command (in PowerShell):

        In Command Prompt:
        bash
        Copy
        dir
        In PowerShell:
        bash
        Copy
        ls
        Ensure that index.html is in the list of files in that directory.

        Run Parcel from the Correct Directory: Once you're in the correct directory where index.html is located, run the
        following command:

        bash
        Copy
        parcel index.html
        This should start the Parcel development server and open the app in the browser at http://localhost:1234.

        <h4>Q2: I notice that when i installed parcel globally, it was not get install in our folder node_module
            directory , why? then where does it was?</h4>
        ANS:- When you install a package globally (using the -g flag), it is not installed in your project's
        node_modules directory. Instead, global packages are installed in a system-wide location, separate from your
        project folder. This allows you to use the package across all projects on your system without having to install
        it repeatedly.

        <h2>Here's why and where global packages are installed:</h2>
        Why Global Packages Are Not in node_modules:
        Global Installation: When you install a package globally, it's not specific to any single project. The package
        is installed in a global location that is shared across all your projects, so you can use it from anywhere on
        your system without installing it again for every project.
        Project-Specific Installation: When you install a package locally, it's installed into the node_modules folder
        of your current project. This keeps dependencies isolated and ensures that each project has its own versions of
        dependencies without affecting others.
        <h2>Where Are Global Packages Installed?</h2>
        The location of globally installed packages depends on your system and configuration. Below are the default
        locations for different operating systems:

        1. On Windows:
        The global packages are usually installed in a directory like:
        bash
        Copy
        C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules
            The global parcel.ps1 script (PowerShell) would be located in:
            bash
            Copy
            C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\parcel.ps1
                2. On macOS/Linux:
                The global packages are installed in a directory like:
                bash
                Copy
                /usr/local/lib/node_modules
                or sometimes in your home directory:
                bash
                Copy
                ~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules
                The executables (like parcel) are linked into a directory in your $PATH, which makes them accessible
                from the command line.
                3. To Find Where Global Packages Are Installed:
                You can run the following command to check where your global npm packages are installed:

                bash
                Copy
                npm root -g
                This will print the path to the global node_modules directory.

                <h2> How to Access Global Packages:</h2>
                Running a Global Package: Once a package is installed globally, you can run it from anywhere in your
                terminal (command line) because global packages are added to your system's PATH.
                For example, after installing parcel globally, you can run:
                bash
                Copy
                parcel index.html
                And this will work, even if you're not in the project folder where parcel is installed, because parcel
                is available globally.
                Key Differences:
                Local installation: Packages are installed inside node_modules in the project directory.
                Global installation: Packages are installed in a global location, accessible from anywhere, without
                being tied to a single project.
                Conclusion:
                When you install a package globally, it is not stored in your project's node_modules folder. It is
                stored in a system-wide location, making it accessible for use in any project.
                To check where global packages are installed, you can run npm root -g.
